# MovieSearch
## <u>[Youtube Video Demo](https://youtu.be/59DaUBc8jeM?si=pWFo1a1YBA5wndXN)</u>

This is a simple Java Swing application to search through a list of movies based 
on various criteria. It was developed by myself and Logan Williams back in fall 2021
when I first started learning Java. We recieved a 100 on this project.

How to run this program 


**1. Clone the repo**
```
git clone git@github.com:MichaelT-178/MovieSearch.git
```

**2. Change to the MovieSearch directory**
```
cd MovieSearch
```

**3. Run the application using the python file**
```
python3 run_program.py
```

**Note:** I took inspiration from the [MovieList](https://github.com/MichaelT-178/MovieSearch/blob/main/src/MovieList.java) class in this project and implemented similar
logic for the [ApartmentList](https://github.com/MichaelT-178/ApartmentRegistry/blob/main/src/ApartmentList.java) class in my ApartmentRegistry application. I also took influence from this project for the GUI design.
